What is the problem you want to solve?

The problem I would like to solve is to see whether it is cheaper eating out or in?

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn't have otherwise?

I know that many people would like to know whether it is cheaper for them to eat out or in. So having data to back that up would be crucial to help people save money.

What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
The data I will use is by looking at the most popular food places to eat in my local area and comparing that to buy groceries for those items. i.e 

Burrito- Chipotle, Toco Bell, Baja Fresh
Hamburger - In- N- Out, Shake Shack, Steak N Shake
Pasta - Olive Garden, Cheesecake Factory, 
salad- Soup Plantation, California Fresh

In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

I will take the resturants I have listed above and compare it to ingridents you buy at grocery store. This is how I will gather data.

What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck
